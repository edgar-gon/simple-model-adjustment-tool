## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Game Development** - Position and orient 3D assets before importing into game engines
- **3D Modeling** - Quick adjustments and previews of GLB models
- **AR/VR Development** - Verify model orientation and positioning for immersive experiences
- **Education** - Learn about 3D transformations and coordinate systems
- **Quality Control** - Check model dimensions and properties before deployment

## 📖 How to Use

### Basic Usage

1. **Load a Model**
   - Click "Load GLB Model" and select a `.glb` file from your computer
   - The model will automatically load and center in the viewport

2. **Navigate the Viewport**
   - **Left-click + Drag** - Move the model
   - **Right-click + Drag** - Rotate the camera
   - **Scroll Wheel** - Zoom in/out

3. **Adjust Position**
   - Select movement mode: All Axes, X Only, Y Only, or Z Only
   - Drag the model or use numeric inputs for precise positioning
   - Click "Set" buttons to apply specific coordinate values

4. **Rotate the Model**
   - Use +45°/-45° buttons for quick rotations on any axis
   - Use the Y-axis slider for smooth continuous rotation
   - Rotation values are displayed in degrees

5. **Highlight Axes**
   - Click X, Y, or Z axis buttons to highlight that axis
   - Pulsing visual indicator helps verify model orientation
   - Tip: Model front should face opposite to Z axis (blue)

6. **Save Your Work**
   - Click "Save .glb" to export the adjusted model
   - File will download as `[filename]_correctedHeight.glb`

### Advanced Features

#### Auto-Adjustment System

1. **Save Current Settings**
   - Adjust a model to your desired position/rotation
   - Click "Save Current Settings" to log the adjustment
   - Builds a database of adjustments in browser localStorage

2. **Auto-Adjust Model**
   - Load a new similar model
   - Click "Auto-Adjust Model"
   - Tool automatically applies adjustments from similar models (within 20% size tolerance)

3. **Export Logs**
   - Click "Export Logs as TXT" to download all saved adjustments
   - Useful for documentation and sharing settings

4. **Clear Logs**
   - Click "Clear All Logs" to reset the adjustment database

#### Water Simulation

- Toggle "Show water plane" checkbox to display/hide water
- Adjust water height with slider or numeric input
- Useful for marine models, boats, or water-based scenes

## 🎓 Tips & Tricks

1. **Model Orientation**
   - Use Z-axis highlighting to verify model facing direction
   - Model front should face opposite to the blue (Z) axis

2. **Precision Adjustment**
   - Use axis-locked movement for precise positioning
   - Numeric inputs allow exact coordinate values

3. **Camera Control**
   - Zoom focuses on cursor position (hover over model parts)
   - Right-click drag to orbit around the model

4. **Performance**
   - Grid and axes scale automatically with camera distance
   - Works well with models up to 100k triangles

5. **Workflow**
   - Save adjustments for similar models to build a database
   - Use auto-adjustment feature for batch processing
